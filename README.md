# chromium-cache-clearer
This program opens Chromium-based browsers (Chrome or Edge, for the purposes of deployment) and injects the URL "chrome://settings/clearBrowserData" by simulating key presses, in order to provide a one-click shortcut for browser cache clearing for less tech-savvy operators.
